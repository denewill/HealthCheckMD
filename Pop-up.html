<h2>What kind of diseases?</h2>

If you do not have any alleriges, then you are in luck, you do not have to worry about any
diseases entering your body, however if you do, there are a couple things you have to worry about.</p>
<h3>Flu/Cold</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px">If you do not have any common allergies that can lead to cold or flu, then there is nothing to worry
about, but if you do, you need to prepare some things. Make sure you set you house temperature to warm using
 your heater, if you do not have one, wear thick clothing to prevent the cold from getting into you. Make
 sure you also clean your room, clean any dust off your table or floors to prevent any diseases going into
 your body.</p>
<h3>Dermatitis</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px">Dryness on your skin/lips can be a little frustrating especially when you want to eat something and when
your skin is dry, it can hurt a lot. To prevent make sure you keep youself moist. Apply lip bumps on your lips or
a moisturizer skin on your legs and hands to prevent dryness on your skin.</p>
<h3>Acnes</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px">Acnes can grow anytime, especially in a dirty environment or dirty atmosphere with pollutions. This does not usually
happen if you often use face soap. Try not to apply too much facial cream on your face as moisturizer creates moisture and acnes
can grow on your face if you apply too much. </p>
