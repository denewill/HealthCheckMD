<h2>HealthCheckMd</h2>

<p> HealthCheckMD is a healthcare website which provides users with information regarding different types of diseases and their current health status. 
This is a beta website created by Vy Nguyen, Michelle Chuwindra, Andrew Andrew, and David Stare for a D/HD Development Project 1 assessment. 
This project is started in August 2019, and presented and completed in October 2019.
</p>

 <p>The project aims to deliver a functional health checking and information website by the designated deadline in October 2019. 
 Features will be added after the project has been presented if desired. During the development, helpful reviews and feedback are the main indicators of improvement and bug discovery. 
 Ideally, a customer support team is established to handle glitches and bug reports from customers if the website has already been set running. 
 For the time being, the development team is in charge of fixing bugs and uploading new features.
</p>

 <p>The website aims to inform users about diseases and their current health. 
 The website provides information about seasonal diseases, their symptoms, their causes, and treatments which patients can attempt at home. 
 The website also informs the users about their BMI and other various health details by calculating them based on the details the users entered and providing a printable table for ease of documentation. 
 Lastly, the website helps users search for the nearest doctors should they need professional medical treatment.
