<a name= "Acne"> <h2>1. Acne</h2> </a>
<p>Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It often causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples, and usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.</p>
<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Whiteheads</li>
	<li>Blackheads</li>
	<li>Small red, tender bumps</li>
	<li>Pimples</li>
	<li>Large, solid, painful lumps beneath the surface of the skin</li>
	<li>Painful, pis-filled lumps beneath the surface of the skin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Excess oil production</li>
	<li>Hair folicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells</li>
	<li>Bacteria</li>
	<li>Excess activity of a type of hormone</li>
</ul>
<p>Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.</p>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<p>Some acne treatments can be bought over the counter at pharmacies or supermarkets. These work by cleaning the skin and drying up excess oil. Mild irritation can occur with such treatments. If this happens, take a short break from treatment and restart after a few days. If the irritation is excessive, stop the medication and speak to your doctor about an alternative.<br><br>
It is a good idea to talk to a pharmacist before you buy a product to find out which treatment might be the most useful for you. If your acne is not improving with over-the-counter treatments or if you have more severe forms of acne, you will need to see your doctor.</p>

<a name= "Asthma"> <h2>2. Asthma</h2></a>
<p >Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.
For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.
Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.
</p>
<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shortness of breath</li>
	<li>Chess tightness</li>
	<li>Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath</li>
	<li>A whistling or wheezing sound when exhaling</li>
	<li>Coughing or wheezing attacks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Exercise-induced asthma, which may be worse when the air is cold and dry</li>
	<li>Occupational asthma, triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust</li>
	<li>Allergy-induced asthma, triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<p >See your doctor</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you think you have asthma. If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from worsening over time.</li>
	<li>To monitor your asthma after diagnosis. If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack.</li>
	<li>If your asthma symptoms get worse. Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often. Don't try to solve the problem by taking more medication without consulting your doctor. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse.</li>
	<li>To review your treatment. Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments.</li>
</ul>

<a name= "Burns"> <h2>3. Burns</h2></a>
<p>Burns are one of the most common household injuries, especially among children. The term “burn” means more than the burning sensation associated with this injury. Burns are characterized by severe skin damage that causes the affected skin cells to die.Most people can recover from burns without serious health consequences, depending on the cause and degree of injury.</p>
<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p >There are three primary types of burns: first-, second-, and third-degree. Each degree is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first-degree being the most minor and third-degree being the most severe. Damage includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>first-degree burns: red, non-blistered skin</li>
	<li>second-degree burns: blisters and some thickening of the skin</li>
	<li>third-degree burns: widespread thickness with a white, leathery appearance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>scalding from hot, boiling liquids</li>
	<li>chemical burns</li>
	<li>electrical burns</li>
	<li>fires, including flames from matches, candles, and lighters</li>
	<li>excessive sun exposure</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<p >First-degree burns are usually treated with home care. Healing time may be quicker the sooner you treat the burn. Treatments for a first-degree burn include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>soaking the wound in cool water for five minutes or longer</li>
	<li>taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief</li>
	<li>applying lidocaine (an anesthetic) with aloe vera gel or cream to soothe the skin</li>
	<li>using an antibiotic ointment and loose gauze to protect the affected area</li>
</ul>
<p >Make sure you don’t use ice, as this may make the damage worse. Never apply cotton balls to a burn because the small fibers can stick to the injury and increase the risk of infection. Also, avoid home remedies like butter and eggs as these are not proven to be effective.</p>

<a name= "CankerSores"> <h2>4. Canker sores</h2></a>
<p >Canker sores, also called aphthous ulcers, are small, shallow lesions that develop on the soft tissues in your mouth or at the base of your gums. Unlike cold sores, canker sores don't occur on the surface of your lips and they aren't contagious. They can be painful, however, and can make eating and talking difficult.
Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two. Check with your doctor or dentist if you have unusually large or painful canker sores or canker sores that don't seem to heal.
</p>
<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p >Most canker sores are round or oval with a white or yellow center and a red border. They form inside your mouth — on or under your tongue, inside your cheeks or lips, at the base of your gums, or on your soft palate. You might notice a tingling or burning sensation a day or two before the sores actually appear.There are several types of canker sores, including minor, major and herpetiform sores.</p>
<h3>Causes:</h3>
<p >The precise cause of canker sores remains unclear, though researchers suspect that a combination of factors contributes to outbreaks, even in the same person.
Possible triggers for canker sores include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A minor injury to your mouth from dental work, overzealous brushing, sports mishaps or an accidental cheek bite</li>
	<li>Toothpastes and mouth rinses containing sodium lauryl sulfate</li>
	<li>Food sensitivities, particularly to chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, cheese, and spicy or acidic foods</li>
	<li>A diet lacking in vitamin B-12, zinc, folate (folic acid) or iron</li>
	<li>An allergic response to certain bacteria in your mouth</li>
	<li>Helicobacter pylori, the same bacteria that cause peptic ulcers</li>
	<li>Hormonal shifts during menstruation</li>
	<li>Emotional stress</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<p >Treatment usually isn't necessary for minor canker sores, which tend to clear on their own in a week or two. But large, persistent or unusually painful sores often need medical care. A number of treatment options exist.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mouth rinses</li>
	<li>Topical products</li>
	<li>Oral medications</li>
</ul>

<a name= "Flu"> <h2>5. Flu</h3></a>
<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p >People who have flu often feel some or all of these symptoms:</p>
<ul>
	<li>fever* or feeling feverish/chills</li>
	<li>cough</li>
	<li>sore throat</li>
	<li>runny or stuffy nose</li>
	<li>muscle or body aches</li>
	<li>headaches</li>
	<li>fatigue (tiredness)</li>
	<li>some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes:</h3>
<p >The flu is caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. These viruses spread when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk, sending droplets with the virus into the air and potentially into the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. You can also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching your own mouth, eyes or nose.
You can spread the flu before you know you are sick, beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. Some people, especially young children and people with weakened immune systems, might be able to infect others for an even longer time.
</p>
<h3>Treatment:</h3>
<p >Usually, you'll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But if you have severe infection or are at higher risk for complications, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), peramivir (Rapivab) or baloxavir (Xofluza). These drugs may shorten your illness by a day or so and help prevent serious complications.
Oseltamivir is an oral medication. Zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn't be used by anyone with certain chronic respiratory problems, such as asthma and lung disease.
Antiviral medication side effects may include nausea and vomiting. These side effects may be lessened if the drug is taken with food.
